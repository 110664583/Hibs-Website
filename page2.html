<p>2013/14 - Hibs get relegated for the first time since 1952
Quite an embarrassing story for Hibs after a rubbish season under Terry Butcher
Hibs got relagated after losing 4-3 on penaties after a 2-2 aggragete draw
The season wasnt succesful with new manager Terry Butcher not a fan favourite with his style of football
All went horribly and somehow Butcher managed to last the whole season as manager</p>
<p>Although having a rubbish season he hibs were the more likely side to come out of the play-offs</p>
<p>The first game went succesfully as Jason Cummings (A young player who had yet forced his way into the side)
He was the main man in the first game as he scored both goals in a 2-0 win that was very hibs sided game</p>
<p>Although the second game at Easter Road, all Hibs had to do was kepp a clean sheet and play well
This obviosly didn't happen as hibs couldn't do this and hamilton did the unexpected</p>
<p>Fulltime Hibs 0-2 Hamilton Aggregate Score Hibs 2-2 Hamiton
This play-off had to be decided by a penalty shoot-out
<p>Hibs win the toss and go first, Saved Kevin Thompson's penalty is saved in the bottom left corner</p>
<p>Hamilton's Grant Gillespe scores in the bottom left corner to make it 0-1</p>
<p>Goal Ryan McGivern makes it 1-1 with agoal in the bottom left corner</p>
<p>Tony Andreau takes the lead again with a goal in the bottom left corner</p>
<p>Liam Craig equalises with a goal right down the middle</p>
<p>Hamilton score with Mickael Antoine-Curier scoring in the bottom right</p>
<p>Owain Tudur-Jones levels it to make it 3-3 with a bottom right corner goal</p>
<p>Jason Scotland converts his penalty in the bottom left corner</p>
<p>Saved, Jason Cummings has his penalty saved in the bottom right corner</p>
<p>And that is it, game over, Hamilton win 4-3 on penalties and Hibs are relagated</p>

<p>2014/15 - New Season, New Manager, New Team, New League</p>
<p>Hibs new it was going to be a difficult season with Hearts and The rangers both being in the same league</p>
<p>Hibs open up a new season very well with a 2-1 win over Livingston with Mark Oxley( Goalie )scoring
It only was in gameweek 2 that Hibs were faced with there first big task, Hearts away
It wasn't a good performance by Alan Stubb's men as they loose 2-1
This was quickly followed by a shock loss to Falkirk at home 0-1</p>
<p>But Hibs did bounce back with 6 wins on the trot including a 3-1 defeat over The rangers at Ibrox
This was followed by 2 draws and a comfortable 4-0 win over Livingston</p>
<p>The next Edinburgh Derby was at Easter Road and Hibs were hanging on at 1-0 to 10 men Hearts
But with a blink of an eye in the 90+2 minute Hearts equalise</p>
<p>Hibs then get knocked out of the league cup in the quater finals on penalties to Dundee United
4 unbeatable games follow with 1 Draw and 3 wins including a 6-3 win over Dumbarton and a win in the Scottish Cup
Another loss to Falkirk and 2 win wre next to happen for Hibs</p>
<p>Hibs are now at home to The rangers next with a 4-0 thrashing over The rangers and agood day all round
And another Edinburgh Derby as another 1-1 draw comes 
11 wins on the bounce had to come including:Two wins in the Scottish Cup and a win at Ibrox</p>
<p>Hibs then go on to looose there next two games to Raith and The rangers
The next 3 games were wins with hibs finally beating there rivals 2-0</p>
<p>Hibs get knocked out of the Scottish Cup to Falkirk who score 15 minutes from time 
Hibs do win there final 3 games of the season</p>
<p>Hibs are second with 70 points with Hearts winning the league on 90 points and The rangers finishing 3rd on 67
This leads onto the play-offs and Hibs are home and away to The rangers
First game was a loss 2-0 and the second game was 1-0 with Cummings scoring in the 90+4 minute but to little to late</p>
<p>An OK first season for Stubbs with Hibs not getting promoted but a positive to take with second place</p>



<p>2015/16 - Lots of new potential with the new signings: Logan, Mcgregor, Gunnarson, Bartley, Henderson, Mcginn, 
Keatings, Stokes and the return of Kevin Thompson</p>
<p> with The rangers still in the league battle for first was still on
Hibs win 4 League Cup games with a shock home win to Aberdeen to secure a Final spot vs Ross County
And Hibs have a win in the Scottish Cup to Raith with a confident win 2-0</p>
<p>Scottish Cup 5th Round was a draw vs Hearts, The Edinburgh Derby was held at tynecastle
It took 32 minutes for Hearts to open the scoring shortly followed by a 44th minute goal by Hearts
The second half was all Hibs they battled for the whole half but by the 80th minute when Hibs broke through 
A brillant Jason Cummings looping header hit the back of the net with 10 minutes to play
With only seconds left Hibs won a corner and after a great save from Mcgregors header 
Paul Hanlon went to shoot and slipped but the ball ended up in the back of the net and that's what matters</p>

<p>Of course the replay was right to follow at Easter Road
It could have been a long game, and it was with Hibs opening the scoring only 4 minutes in
Hearts did put the ball in the back of the net but of course the player was offside
The game was tense and pretty boring but in the 76 minute the Hearts defender to his anger out on the ref
and getting himself sent off, just 2 minutes later Jason Cummings kicks the ball away in frustration and he 
recieves a second yellow. Nun the less Hibs do get the win and advance to the Quaters</p>

<p>After that Hibs go on to win their next 4 league games before the Scottish Cup.
Inverness at home was the tie and Hibs were very confident after going 1-0 up with a James Keatings strike.
With Hibs being the more dominent team Inverness make it 1-1 out of nothing with Mbuyi-Mutombo scoring.
This game will have to be played a Inverness next week after the League Cup Final vs Ross County.</p>
<p>League Cup Final day with hibs cruising past St Johnstone in the semi's and Ross County who suprisingly beating
Celtic ( who were the favourites ) 3-1.
 Hibs were favourites going into this game as Ross County where bottom of the table.
 Hibs didn't prove their confidence with Michael Gardyne opening the scoring 25 minutes in.
 Hibs did bounce back with Liam Fontaine equalising 45 minutes in.
 It was neck-n-neck until the 90+1 minute when Alex Shalk had a goal givin to him on a plate by Fontaine.
 Ross County win the League Cup</p>
<p>Hibs did bounce back in the league going unbeaten in 5 games:2 draws, 3 wins.
And Hibs do beat Iverness 2-1 in a replay in Inverness
The Scottish Cup Semi-Final was to follow with Hibs playing Dundee United.
A very boring game but the penalty Hibs had a penalty 29 minutes in and jason Cummings stepped up,
and he tried to do the paneka but only was he to miss the whole goal.
The game was a bore fest until penalties arrived, with Hibs usual goalie Oxley being suspended new goalkeeper
Conrad Logan was to replace him and had played a very decent game. But he was the hero for the penalties
Dundee united won the toss and were taking their pen first.</p>
<p>Saved, Blair Spittal has his shot saved by Conrad Logan in the bottom right corner</p>
<p>Goal, John McGinn scores into the bottom left corner</p>
<p>Saved again by Logan, Billy McKay misses in the bottom left</p>
<p>Goal, Paul Hanlon scores in the bottom right corner</p>
<p>Goal, Paul Dixon scores in the bottom left corner</p>
<p>Goal, Martin Boyle scores in the top left corner</p>
<p>Goal, Guy Demel scores in the centre of the goal</p>
<p>Goal, Jason Cummings scores in the bottom left corner</p> 
<p>And that's it Hibs are going to the Scottish Cup Final</p>

<p>With that game finished Hibs do go on to be unbeaten in their next 4 games, including at 3-2 defeat over
The rangers and 3 wins and 1 draw</p>
<p>The final table did end up with The rangers winning the league on 81 points
Falkirk and Hibs both finished on 70 points but Falkirk had a goal difference of +27 and Hibs had +25
So Hibs finish 3rd and Falkirk finish 2nd Hibs with have to play 3 play-offs to get back to the top</p>
<p>The first play-off was Hibs vs Raith Rovers in Kirkaldy and Hibs come out unsuccesful with a 1-0 loss</p>
<p>Luckily Hibs did win the reverse home game 2-0 with McGinn and Mcgregor getting on the scoresheet 8&12 minutes in</p>
<p> Hibs were to play Falkirk next in the play-offs at Easter Road.
Hibs did go 1-0 down but goals from Henderson and Mcgregor make it 2-1 Hibs, until Falkirk equalise to make it 2-2
The next leg was in Falkirk and Hibs did go 1-0 down but did recover with Keatings scoring 2 to make it 1-2
Falkirk equalised and everyone thought it was going to go to extra-time until Mchugh scored in the 90+2 minute
and Falkirk win the game 3-2 desparating for Hibs, amazing for Falkirk. Hibs have no chance of getting back up</p>
<p>When all hope is gone the Scottish Cup was to come, After The rangers beating Celtic it was them they had
to play in the Scottish Cup Final at Hampden on the 21st of May 2016</p>
<p> going into this The rangers had the bigger advantage with them already getting promoted earlier on in the season
Although both teams had won twice ( both of those being at home )
The game went exactly to plan with Anthony Stokes openung the scoring only 3 minutes in 
The game was fairly quite but the fans were as loud as they could be
Kenny Millar had been very shy until the 27th minute when he won a 50/50 header vs McGregor to level the scorings
Straight after that eqauliser Hibs go right up the park and Anthony Stokes hits the woodwork
Hibs did have most of the chances but 1-1 was the half-time score.
Second half was were things realy started to light up
Andy Haliday scored a belter 64 minutes in to gives The rangers advantage with not more than 30 minutes left
Plenty of chances for both teams but it was only until the 80th minute when the scoreline changed again
Liam Henderson had been brought on for Liam Fontaine 70 minutes in was the supplier for Stokes to score again
His delivered cross was sublime and was perfectly placed for Stokes to level things up
And it was he who stepped up to put in another cross in injury time, 90+2 and yet again another great cross
His cross was met by the club captain David Gray and his brilliant header hit the back of the net
The scenes were unbeleivable as everyone of those 20,000 traviling Hibs support jumped into pandemonium.
Fulltime The rangers 2-3 Hibernian Hibs win the scottish cup for the first time since 1902</p>

<p>2016/17 - Hibs are still in the Scottish Championship but the new team to beat is Dundee United after their
relagation and Falkirk are still another team for Hibs to look out for</p>
<p>As Hibs did win the Scottish Cup this does mean that they qualify for Europe, Europa League qualification
was to come and Hibs very unluckily get drawn against BrÃ³ndby who are a very strong side
Hibs were to face them at home first but Hibs have let go of some of their Scottish Cup heroes
Anthony Stokes, Conrad Logan, Kevin Thompson, Liam Henderson, Chris Dagnall, Farid El Alagui and Mark Oxley
But their was a new manager to be entering, Neil Lennon was the new man and he brought in new players.
Players like : Grant Holt, Brian Graham, Ross Laidlaw,Chris Humphrey, Brian McLean, Ofir Marciano, Andrew Shinnie,
Kris Commons and Efe Ambrose.</p>
<p>The season didn't start well with Hibs out of the Challenge Cup and the League Cup in early rounds</p>
<p>This did follow by 13 well played games with 4 Draws, 8 Wins and 1 Loss to Dundee United
Then the Scottish Cup came with Hibs drawing against Bonnyrigg Rose away but because Bonnyrigg's stadium was
to small to host the game so the neutral stadium was tynecastle for the 4th round
A stong win 8-1 with Shinnie, Humphrey, Stevenson, Forster, Keatings(2) and Cummings(2) getting on the scoresheet </p>
<p>The league was followed with a draw and a win against QOS and Ayr</p>
<p>Then for the 2nd year on the trot Hibs play Hearts at tyncastle for the 5th round of the Scottish Cup
I could take forever to write this but because it was a boring 0-0 game I won't but it was all about the replay.
The replay at easter road was an amazing game it wasn't until the 21st minute when the score changed
A great ball by Shinnie was met by Cummings to make it 1-0 Hibs
This was followed by another great ball by Shinnie but it was Cumming's ball that made Holt make it 2-0 37 minutes in
At half-time it looked impossible for Hearts to come back and it was with Hibs continuing there great form
It only took 18 second half minutes for Hibs to add to their lead and this time it was Shinnie's shot 
that was fumbled by young goalie Jack Hamilton to make it 3-0 to the Hibees
Hibs were going to see the game out well until Darren McGregor gave away a silly penalty in the 70th minute
Goncalves's penalty was saved by Marciano and he saved the rebound shot as well but the second save wasn't good 
enough as it fell to Goncalves again to tap it in 3rd time lucky.
Hibs did manage to see the game out from then to have a succesful 3-1 win in the Edinburgh Derby</p>

<p>Hibs did Win 4, Draw 4 and lose 1 coming back to the league
<p>Hibs had the chance to win the League by beating Queen of the South and both Falkirk and Dundee United don't win
With the early game between Dundee U and Ayr drawing 0-0 all was at steak at 15:00
Hibernian cruised in their game with Mcgregor getting a double in the first half
The great form continued into the second half with Sir David Gray scoring only 3 minutes in
The only downside was that Hibs didn't score any more in this half
In Falkirk the game between Falkirk and St Mirren was nail-biting
St Mirren scored 5 minutes in and you could here the cheers around Easter Road
This lasted 15 minutes with Falkirk equalising and that was that for the first half
The second half is when things started to heat up with St Mirren leading again 60 minutes in
Falkirk did reply 80 minutes in and everyone in Easter Road started to get nervous
But it turned out to be to little to late as they could not find the winner in Falkirk
At this point celebrations started echoing as the news had spread that Falkirk had drawn
This does mean that after 3 years Hibs are back in the Premiership and the top of scottish football</p>

<p>The next 10 games had seen Hibs have 5 Draws, 4 Wins and 1 Loss 1 Win in the Scottish Cup Quaters
Then it was the Scottish Cup Semis Hibs vs Aberdeen at Hampden 
The game didn't start to well at all with Hibs conceeding 23 seconds in and again 25 minutes in
But Hibs did bounce back with Holt and McGeough leveling things up and just as Extra Time was approcing
Adam Rooney had a shot that seemed to be going wide until deflected by McGregor to put the ball in the net 
This was to win the game for Aberdeen. The 2 in a row was over for Hibernian.</p>
<p>The game was played really well by the Hibees and they continued there good form in the league.
The final 4 games were 3 Wins and 1 Draw with Hibs finishing the season on a high note</p>
<p>The table finished looking like this : Hibs 1st on 71 points, Falkirk second on 60 points
Dundee United 3rd on 57 points and Ayr 10th on 33 points and getting relagated with Raith Rovers through play-offs</p>
<p>Inverness were relagated and Hamilton survived the play-offs to stay up in the premiership</p>
<p>2017/18 - Hibs are back in the premiership and back to the top for the first time in 3 years</p>
<p>Hibs did sign some people at the start of the season but did let go of a few as well
Danny Swanson, Simon Murray, Ofir Marciano, Steven Whittaker, Anthony Stokes and Scott Bain all joining the club
But Keatings, McLean, Harris, Humphrey, Holt, Cummings, Fyvie, Forster, Stanton, Hanling, Martin and Fontaine
all exiting the club</p>
<p>Hibs cruised through the league cup group stage in first place in group A
They started the season well with 3 Wins and a defeat over The rangers
But Hibs did have their first loss to Hamilton at home and Hamilton were turning into a bit of a bogey team
Then 6 undefeated games followed with 4 Draws and 2 Wins and a exciting 2-2 draw vs Celtic
Then a loss to Aberdeen and a Semi-Final loss to Celtic in the league cup a exciting 4-2 game
The first Edinburgh Derby did not dissapoint with hibs winning 1-0 over the jamtarts with a Murray goal</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VuX4gsCHiF8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Then a 3 win game for Hibs but a 2-1 loss to St Johnstone 
Then another 4 unbeaten run with another victoy over The rangers and a 2-2 draw with Celtic
Then a big 4-1 loss to Aberdeen but 4 unbeaten games in the league but a 1-0 loss to Hearts in the Scottish Cup</p>
<p>The next run of games are very successful with : 7 Wins, 3 Draws and 1 Loss including a 2-0 Derby Win</p>
<p>Going into yhe split Hibs had 5 games. The teams were : Aberdeen, The rangers, Celtic, Hearts and Killie</p>
<p>The first game of the split was vs Celtic and a victory 2-1 with Slivka and Maclaren scoring</p> 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ETYX5sWUftQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The next game was vs Killie and a comfortable win 5-3 but a brilliant game to watch</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B7lF7W3aJEY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The middle fixture was against Aberdeen a very boring 0-0 draw but Maclaren's penalty miss was a big factor</p>
<p>The penultimate game was the Edinburgh Derby and it was unsuccesful with a 2-1 defeat </p>
<p>the final game was vs The rangers at home and it was a stunner. Hinbs had to win 5-0 to finish 3rd
It was all going to plan hHibs going 3-0 up early doors but were pinned back to 3-5 until 
Jamie Maclaren completed his Hat-trick and sent Lennon on a aroeplane</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GKB0NGpWuIY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The table finished looking like this : Celtic 1st (82) Aberdeen 2nd (73) The rangers 3rd (70)
Hibs 4th (67) 5th Kilmarnock (59) 6th Hearts(49) and both Ross County and Partick Thistle relagated
St Mirren and Livi getting promoted from the Championship</p>



<p>Season : 2018/19 new signings with the likes of Stevie Mallan, Daryl Horgan, Mark Milligan, Adam Bogdan,
Thomas Agyepong, Emerson Hyndman, and Duel Flo Kamberi and Jamie Maclaren </p>
<p> the season goes OK with only 1 Derby win and a brilliant Europe run</p>
<p>Neil lennon does exit the club in January and is replaced by Paul Heckingbottom who was a succesful
manager at Barnsley</p>
But by the end of the regular season in the top 6 (just) but a very unsuccesful split with
0 Wins 2 Draws and 3 Losses </p> 
<p>Hibs do finish the season in 5th but a great comeback aftyer Hibs looked like the bottom six was near</p>
<p> this was only a quick round up of last season but the main part of the season was this game</p>
