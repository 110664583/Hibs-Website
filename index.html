<p>This page will be everything about Hibernian from my current knowledge</p>
<p>Hibs(Nickname).Currently as it stands are not in form after the Edinburgh Derby</p>
<p>Heckingbottom started his managerial career at Hibs well but since the new season everything is going downhill.</p>
<p>On this page there will be 2 pages on Hibernian.</p>
<p>This page is to give you a bit of an overlook on what this will be about.</p>
<p>This season has been horrendous for the Hibees as they are only on 7 points with 1 win( first game of the season)
Heckingbottoms plans are not working and he is on a very shoogaly peg as Hibs are niot playing the entertaining
football that was played over the last 3 seasons</p>
<p>The players that he has brought in do not replace the players that played last season and the tactics that are
being played are shambolic</p>
<p>after Hibs drawing 2-2 with Ross County and Hibs were 2-0 up with 15 minutes left. Boos ring around the stadium</p>  
<p>Hibs play Livi tonight and i will inform you about that game tomorrow, fingers crossed</p>
<p>Hibs didn't win SHIT HEXIT </p>
<p>Levein is oot and Hearts have Austin MacPhee to take care of them</p>
<p>What a horrendous game Hibs 2-5 Celtic</p>
<p>Players that don't deserve to play for Hibs again : Maxwell, James, Vela, Mallan, Horgan, Doidge</p>
